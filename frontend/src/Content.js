        I am a mini-founder at <a className = "links" href = "https://linktr.ee/breakingbarriers">Breaking Barriers in Tech</a>, a nurturing and inclusive community which aims to combat obstacles faced by minorities in tech. We are building a strong unified community through informative workshops, fun events and such. I am a slack moderator at <a className = "links" href = "https://www.womenwhocode.com/python">Women Who Code Python</a> by beginning a new initiative called "Pythonic days" where I share tips and nuances about Python to drum up technical discussions and keep conversation flowing amongst members every week. I also volunteer at <a className = "links" href = "https://www.womenwhocode.com/nyc"> Women Who Code NYC </a> and occasionally help with behind-the-scenes event moderation.

        During my free time, I work on cool side projects to solve problems that I face every day. Currently, I am working on building a Chrome extension called TinyNotes, which is a basic note-taking app that would stay on my new tab window built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I try to add value to young, aspiring tech enthusiasts such as myself by writing out tiny technical posts at <a className = "links" href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a>.
